# SMT-Breadboard
A cool breadboard for prototyping SMD projects!

### How can you make one of this?
* By yourself
* PCBWay - If you don't know PCBWay, here is my invite https://goo.gl/JwBhXn 

### Do you need to solder a QFP/SOIC/TSSOP component? 
Just buy a SMD to DIP adapter and glue it on the PCB and wire the pins out to the breadboard!

### Any suggestion? 
Issue it here! If it's possible, I will get it into the project!
